# Tree seedling metamodel
Code repository for model integration with experimental tree seedling data.

Example code lives in `inst/seedlings.r`. Note that, to run these examples, the private repository `treeSeedlingMetamodelData` (available on request) is also required.

Installation is simplest using the `devtools` package:

    devtools::install_github('mtalluto/tree_seedling_metamodel')
    
or download the latest [release](https://github.com/mtalluto/tree_seedling_metamodel/releases) and install it using `devtools::install_local` or (from the command line) `R CMD INSTALL`.
